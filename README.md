# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:
To apply key UX design methods such as Crazy 8s, user stories, scenarios, task flows, and information architecture.
## Algorithm:
# Crazy 8s – 8 Low-Fidelity Idea
1. Quick Book Button
o One-tap “Book Appointment” on home screen.
2. Specialty Shortcuts
o Tiles for Cardiology, Dermatology, Pediatrics → skip search.
3. Symptom Checker
o User enters symptoms → app suggests doctor/type.
4. Slot Calendar View
o A full calendar showing only free time slots in green.
5. Doctor Comparison
o Compare experience, ratings, fees before booking.
6. Voice-Based Booking
o “Book a dentist tomorrow evening” → auto-schedule.
7. Smart Rebooking
o For follow-up appointments → “Rebook same doctor”.
8. Emergency Fast Lane
o Quick-connect for urgent care with the nearest available doctor.
 ## 2. User Stories
# User Story 1
As a patient, I want to book an appointment easily, so that I don’t waste time in hospital
queues.
# User Story 2
As a new user, I want to search doctors by symptoms, so that I can find the right
specialist quickly.
# User Story 3
As a busy professional, I want to view available slots instantly, so that I can book an
appointment that fits my schedule.
# User Story 4
As a returning patient, I want to rebook my previous doctor, so that I get consistent
treatment.
# User Story 5
As an elderly user, I want to use voice commands for booking, so that I don’t have to type
on the app.
## 3. Scenario
User Story Chosen: User Story 3 — Busy professional viewing slots.
Scenario
Rahul, a 28-year-old IT employee, is at his office during a short break between meetings. He
has been experiencing headaches and needs to schedule a doctor visit. He feels stressed and
rushed because he has only 10 minutes before his next meeting.
Rahul opens the hospital app on his phone. The interface immediately shows a list of doctors
he consulted previously. He taps on Dr. Anita’s profile. A clean calendar appears with
available time slots in green. Rahul quickly checks for evening slots, finds one at 7:30 PM,
and taps “Book.”
He receives a confirmation message instantly. Rahul feels relieved and returns to his desk
feeling confident he managed his schedule well.
